# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.

# * Fine Tuning

# * Query Cache Configuration
#

#
# * Logging and Replication
#
# Both location gets rotated by the cronjob.
# Be aware that this log type is a performance killer.
# As of 5.1 you can enable the log at runtime!

#log-queries-not-using-indexes
#
# The following can be used as easy to replay backup logs or for replication.
# note: if you are setting up a replication slave, see README.Debian about
#       other settings you may need to change.

#
# Accept only connections using the latest and most secure TLS protocol version.
# ssl-cipher=TLSv1.2


#
# * Character sets
#
# MySQL/MariaDB default is Latin1, but in Debian we rather default to the full
# utf8 4-byte character set. See also client.cnf
#
character-set-server        = utf8mb4
